Hello, my dear best and only collegue friend pal!
I gotta admit, that rapping really isn't a good form of communication. In fact, it's actually probably the worst way to do so...
You did make it to day 2 (hopefully on first try) though. That mean at least I did an okay job, right? <u<
Besides, what's the fun to do things in absolutely normal, efficient, boring ways? OvO
Anyway, some ingredients that were out of stock are restocked today.
Also, since there's going to be more customers coming more frequently so I've picked a wacky new song. (hopefully not copyrighted)
Just press play whenever you are ready!
