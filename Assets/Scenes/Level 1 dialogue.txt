Hey, human. Welcome to your first day at work.
Today is the first day of the summer vacation. There's going to be so many more customers than usual. There's no way we'll be serving all of them in the normal way.
Fortunately, your best and most helpful collegue has a brilliant idea.
I'll take the orders, and tell you which ingredients you need to add by rapping.
You don't need to follow the exact beats or orders. Just put the right ingredients into the cup in time.
This is definitely obviously going to be the most efficient way to make drinks. (Hopefully) (Doubtfully) 
Click on each of the container, and I'll pronounce their name the way I prefer to do.
If you are ready, press the play button on the bottome left.
