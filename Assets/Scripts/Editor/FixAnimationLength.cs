/// 
/// Provides a Unity Editor function that 'fixes' the animation length on selected AnimationClip assets.
/// You can also select directories to process the animations inside.
///
/// It adds the menu entry "Fix Animation Length" to the Assets menu. You can also access it when right
/// clicking on the Project view. Hence, you can select assets in the Project view and right click -> fix.
///
/// The assets need to be saved in order for this to work. Thus, the script saves all assets before commencing.
///
/// Based on alstonc99's script at http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/131340-Reduce-animationclip-length.
/// Thanks for finding the solution and sharing it.
///
/// This script is in the public domain, feel free to improve and share.
///
/// NOTE: Unity seems to cache the selected assets. If you select all your assets and run this script, Unity
///       might hang for a few seconds. Afterwards processing all your assets again is faster.
///      
/// DISCLAIMER: We currently don't know what purpose the bogus entry serves. Use at your own risk!
